# Home-Assistant Configuration

This is my personal home automation configuration using Home Assistant (http://home-assistant.io).  My configuration is built from various places all over the internet (mainly docs and other config examples to get an idea of how to do things) and many hours of testing and retesting. The purpose of me publishing my config is so that i can keep track of my changes and perhaps gice others ideas on what they can do with their HA setups..

_**NOTE:** I have excluded files and folders with sensitive data (.conf files, db files, zone folder)._
